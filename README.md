Smart Inventory System
The Warehouse Inventory Management System is designed for warehouse managers and users to manage inventory, check-ins, requests, payments, package tracking, and communication via live chat. The application leverages Android SDK, and Firebase for backend services (authentication, database, notifications), and provides a seamless user interface for efficient management.
It ensures real-time synchronization of data, allowing users to access up-to-date information and make informed decisions anytime, anywhere.
